I am <strong>Kushagra Gour</strong> a.k.a. Chin Chang (don't ask me why I chose that name). I presently live in New Delhi - capital of India working as a front-end developer at an awesome startup called <a target="_blank" href="http://wingify.com">Wingify</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have been developing casual games for 5 years now and I am still not bored :) I started making games on Flash platform and have recently being experimenting with some other technologies like HTML5, XNA, UDK, Unity, Silverlight etc. Though my primary love still is and will be FLASH. Other than programming, I like to sketch, play soccer, listen to christmas carols and chinese music, play instruments like flute and piano.
</p>

<p>
I started this blog as a repository to record my experiments, thoughts and achievements so I could look and remember them when I get old. More importantly to share my knowledge (whatever little I have ) and help out newbie programmer and developers.
</p>

<p>
My dream is to completely integrate games in education one day. If you have a similar dream, please do contact me so that we can join hands in spreading game development everywhere.
</p>

<p>
Don't know what else to say. Its not that I am out of words but out of power ( laptop battery you see). Well thats it about me.
