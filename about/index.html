नमस्ते (Namaste) everyone !
</p>


<p>
I am <strong>Kushagra Gour</strong> a.k.a. Chin Chang (don't ask me why I chose that name) and yup, thats me on the left. I currently live in New Delhi - capital of India. I would like to describe myself as a Flash Evangelist, an enthusiast Programmer, an Indie Game Developer, a Self Learner and a person who is passionate about every minute of life (seconds would be too short to be passionate about).
</p>

<p>
I have been programming and developing casual games for 4 years now and I am still not bored :) I started out game development on Flash platform and have recently experimented with some other stuffs like Silverlight, XNA, UDK, Unity etc. Though my primary love still is FLASH. Other than programming, I like to paint, play soccer, listen to Christmas and Chinese music, play instruments like flute and piano.
</p>

<p>
About my academic qualification, I am presently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering from MSIT, New Delhi and hope to earn a degree soon if everything goes well. I believe in practical stuffs rather than theory and that is partially the reason I don't attend much lectures at college. Wish we had only practicals in schools :P
</p>

<p>
I started this blog as a repository to record my creations, thoughts and achievements so I could look and remember them when I get old. But recently have started writing game tutorials to share my knowledge (whatever little I have ) and help out newbie programmer and developers.
</p>

<p>
My dream is to start my own game company and make it one of the most reputed in India and in the world. If you have a similar dream, please do contact me so that we can join hands in spreading game development everywhere .
</p>

<p>
Don't know what else to say. Its not that I am out of words but out of power ( laptop battery you see). Well thats it about me.
</p>

<p>
Cheers! <br>
