title: Hello World!

Hey!

As a custom, I write my first post on my new blog (powered by Jekyll and Github).

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var str = "Hello World!";

console.log(str);

{% endhighlight %}

I'll be soon writing a post about my experience with switching from wordpress to really awesome Jekyll.

Stay tuned.
